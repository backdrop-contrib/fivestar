The Five Star voting module adds a clean, attractive voting widget to nodes in Drupal 5. It features:

 * jQuery rollover effects and AJAX no-reload voting
 * Graceful degradation to an HTML rating form when JavaScript is turned off
 * Per-nodetype configurability
 * Support for anonymous voters
 * Spam protection to keep users from filling your DB with bogus votes
 * Easy-to-use integration with Views module for lists sorted by rating, or filtered by min/max ratings
 * A Fivestar CCK field for use in custom node types
 * An easy-to-use Form API element type for use in other modules

Fivestar was designed by Nate Haug and Jeff Eaton of Lullabot.
